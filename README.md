# Demo-Test-App
This repository contains a simple application which allows user to enter the details, update and delete them.

# Description
This is implemented using HTML, CSS and PHP. I have used MySQL as the database and XAMPP for running it on localhost.

# Building
1. Install MySQL and XAMPP in your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository to a local folder in c:/xampp/htdocs
3. Create the database. Give your MySQL username and password correctly. (localhost/foldername/db.php)
4. Create tables in database. (localhost/foldername/createTable.php)
5. Finally run the application. (localhost/foldername)

You can see the implemented application using test site http://demotestapp.epizy.com/
